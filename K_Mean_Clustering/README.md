# K-Means Clustering of Iris Dataset
The Iris flower dataset is a classic multivariate dataset in statistics and machine learning. It contains measurements of four features (sepal length, sepal width, petal length, and petal width) for 150 iris flowers, with 50 samples from each of three species: Iris setosa, Iris virginica, and Iris versicolor. The dataset was introduced by Ronald Fisher in 1936 as an example of linear discriminant analysis to distinguish between the three species based on their morphological features.
