# Iris Dataset Clustering with K-Means

## Project Overview

This project applies **K-Means clustering** on the **Iris dataset** to group flowers based on features (sepal/petal length & width) and compare clusters with actual species. K-Means is a **centroid-based algorithm** that assigns points to the nearest centroid iteratively.

## Features

* Sepal length (cm)
* Sepal width (cm)
* Petal length (cm)
* Petal width (cm)

Target (for evaluation only): species (`setosa`, `versicolor`, `virginica`)

---

## Workflow

1. **Load and preprocess data**: standardize features using `StandardScaler`.
2. **Elbow Method**: determine optimal number of clusters (`k=3`).

   * **Visualization**: include **elbow curve plot** here.
4. **K-Means Clustering**: fit with `k=3` and predict cluster labels.

5. **Evaluation**:

   * **Clustering Accuracy**: 0.833 (pseudo-accuracy by majority voting)
   * **Adjusted Rand Index (ARI)**: measures agreement with true labels
6. **Visualization of clusters**:

   * Scatter plot of **Petal Length vs Petal Width** colored by clusters, with centroids
   * Optional: overlay **true species labels** for comparison
7. **Feature distributions**:

   * Histograms/KDE plots of features by species

   * Boxplots of features by species

   * These visualizations help interpret cluster separation

## Insights

* K-Means successfully separates **Setosa**, while some overlap exists between **Versicolor** and **Virginica**.
* Optimal cluster number (`k=3`) matches the number of species.
* Visualizations clarify cluster quality and misclassifications.

---

## Applications

* Customer segmentation
* Pattern recognition
* Any unsupervised grouping task
