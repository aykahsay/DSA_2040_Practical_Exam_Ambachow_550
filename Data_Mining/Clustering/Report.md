# Iris Dataset Clustering with K-Means

## Project Overview

This project applies **K-Means clustering** on the **Iris dataset** to group flowers based on features (sepal/petal length & width) and compare clusters with actual species. K-Means is a **centroid-based algorithm** that assigns points to the nearest centroid iteratively.

## Features

* Sepal length (cm)
* Sepal width (cm)
* Petal length (cm)
* Petal width (cm)

Target (for evaluation only): species (`setosa`, `versicolor`, `virginica`)

---

## Workflow

1. **Load and preprocess data**: standardize features using `StandardScaler`.
   6. **Visualization of clusters**:

   * Scatter plot of **Petal Length vs Petal Width** colored by clusters, with centroids
   * Optional: overlay **true species labels** for comparison
2. **Feature distributions**:

   * Histograms/KDE plots of features by species

   * Boxplots of features by species

   * These visualizations help interpret cluster separation

3. **Elbow Method**: determine optimal number of clusters (`k=3`).

   * **Visualization**: include **elbow curve plot** here.
4. **K-Means Clustering**: fit with `k=3` and predict cluster labels.

5. **Evaluation**:
The clustering analysis on the Iris dataset was performed using different values of k in K-Means. Cluster quality was evaluated using the Adjusted Rand Index (ARI), which measures similarity between the predicted clusters and actual species labels. The results were:

- k = 2 → ARI = 0.5706
- k = 3 → ARI = 0.7292
- k = 4 → ARI = 0.6297
The highest ARI was obtained at k = 3, which aligns with the known number of species in the Iris dataset, making it the optimal choice. Misclassifications occurred mainly between Iris versicolor and Iris virginica, as their features partially overlap in the dataset.

In real-world applications, clustering can be used for customer segmentation, grouping individuals with similar purchasing behavior for targeted marketing. It can also be applied to anomaly detection, image segmentation, and bioinformatics.

Since this dataset is real (not synthetic), results accurately reflect the natural patterns in Iris species, without biases from artificial data generation.
   * **Adjusted Rand Index (ARI)**: measures agreement with true labels

## Insights

* K-Means successfully separates **Setosa**, while some overlap exists between **Versicolor** and **Virginica**.
* Optimal cluster number (`k=3`) matches the number of species.
* Visualizations clarify cluster quality and misclassifications.

---

## Applications

* Customer segmentation
* Pattern recognition
* Any unsupervised grouping task
